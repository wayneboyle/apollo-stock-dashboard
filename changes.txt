The current design is plain with a white background, black text, and basic chart colors, which looks unprofessional. I want to transform this dashboard to match the style of a Bloomberg financial dashboard, which has a dark theme, high-contrast colors, and a professional look. Additionally, I want to add interactive date range controls to allow users to select custom date ranges for the charts. Hereâ€™s how to modify the dashboard step by step:
Change the Background and Overall Theme:
Set the dashboard's main background color to a dark gray or black (e.g., #1A1A1A or #000000), similar to Bloomberg's dark theme.

Update the text color for the dashboard title "Stock Analysis Dashboard" and all chart titles ("AAPL Price (OHLC)", etc.) to white (#FFFFFF) for high contrast against the dark background.

Change the background color of each chart panel (the area behind the charts) to a slightly lighter dark gray (e.g., #2A2A2A) to distinguish the charts from the main background.
Update Chart Colors for a Bloomberg Style:
For the "AAPL Price (OHLC)" chart (candlestick chart):
Use green (#00FF00) for candlesticks where the close is higher than the open (bullish).

Use red (#FF0000) for candlesticks where the close is lower than the open (bearish).

Set the chart gridlines to a subtle light gray (e.g., #444444) to maintain visibility without overpowering the dark background.
For the "AAPL Price Trend with SMA(20)" chart (line chart):
Change the price line color to a bright cyan (#00FFFF) to stand out against the dark background.

Change the 20-day SMA line color to a neon orange (#FFA500) for contrast.

Set the gridlines to the same light gray (#444444).
For the "AAPL Trading Volume" chart (histogram):
Use a bright blue (#1E90FF) for the volume bars to make them pop against the dark background.

Set the gridlines to light gray (#444444).
For the "AAPL RSI(14)" chart (line chart):
Change the RSI line color to a bright magenta (#FF00FF) for visibility.

Update the overbought (70) and oversold (30) threshold lines to a dashed white line (#FFFFFF) with a subtle opacity (e.g., 0.7).

Set the gridlines to light gray (#444444).
Adjust Text and Labels:
Change all axis labels (price, volume, RSI values, and dates) to white (#FFFFFF) for readability on the dark background.

Use a clean, professional font like "Arial" or "Helvetica" for all text, with a font size of 12px for axis labels and 14px for chart titles.

Ensure the ticker input field ("AAPL") and "Analyze" button have a dark background (#2A2A2A) with white text (#FFFFFF), and add a subtle white border (1px solid #FFFFFF) to make them stand out.
Add Interactive Date Range Controls:
Add a date range selector above the charts, below the "Stock Analysis Dashboard" title and ticker input field.

The date range selector should include two input fields: a "Start Date" and an "End Date", each with a calendar picker for user-friendly date selection.

Style the date input fields to match the dark theme: dark background (#2A2A2A), white text (#FFFFFF), and a white border (1px solid #FFFFFF).

Add a "Apply" button next to the date range inputs, styled with a dark background (#2A2A2A), white text (#FFFFFF), and a white border (1px solid #FFFFFF).

When the user selects a date range and clicks "Apply", update all four charts to display data only within the selected date range. Ensure the charts dynamically adjust their x-axis (date axis) to reflect the new range.
Enhance Layout and Spacing:
Add a subtle border (1px solid #444444) around each chart panel to give a clean, separated look.

Increase the padding inside each chart panel to 10px to avoid a cramped appearance.

Ensure the charts are evenly spaced with a 10px gap between them, maintaining the current 2x2 grid layout.
Final Touches:
Add a subtle box shadow to each chart panel (e.g., box-shadow: 0 0 5px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)) to give a slight 3D effect, enhancing the professional look.

Ensure all chart elements (lines, bars, candlesticks) have a slight glow or thickness to make them visually striking against the dark background.
Please modify the existing dashboard code to implement these changes. Ensure the functionality of the charts remains intact, and only update the visual style and add the date range controls as described. If you need to make assumptions about the charting library or framework used, assume the dashboard is built with Python using Dash (Plotly) for the charts, as this is a common setup for such dashboards. After making the changes, show the updated code and confirm that the dashboard now has a Bloomberg-like dark theme with interactive date range controls.
